Run npm install to get all the dependencies necessary to deploy the project, don't forget to run the server first, in order to be able to process the requests.  
Run npm start to deploy the development server.
## Features:
the application will show you a start screen where you can either search an employee by id or search all the employees.  
### Search by id:
To search an employee by id, write the id in the input field and press search.  
### Fecth list of all employees:
To get a list with all the employees, just press the search button letting the input field empty.   
Remember that the external API will block your request if you make more than one petition in a short period of time, I recommend to wait a minute between requests  
in order to not be blocked by the external API.
